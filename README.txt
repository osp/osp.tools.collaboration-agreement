OSP's Collaboration Agreement
=============================

A document to inform our future collaborators about the way we work.

- - -
TO make things easier, the document is edited on an etherpad.
To download the pad as an HTML file and to insert CSS, you can run in your terminal:
    bash collab-agreement.sh

It will update the file `source/collab-agreement.html`.
You can then open it in Chromium and export it as a PDF (made for an A5 8 pages booklet).
